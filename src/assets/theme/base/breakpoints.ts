/* This TypeScript code snippet defines an object named `breakpoints` with a nested `values` object.
The `values` object contains key-value pairs representing different breakpoint sizes commonly used
in responsive web design. Each key corresponds to a breakpoint size label (e.g., xs, sm, md) and its
associated value is the pixel width for that breakpoint. */
